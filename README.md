TypeSculpt is a cutting-edge text-to-3D generation system that employs an adaptive attention mechanism to create highly personalized and detailed 3D objects from textual descriptions. It leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to bridge the gap between natural language and 3D representation, enabling users to effortlessly generate 3D models tailored to their specific requirements.

## Installation

1. **Python and Environment Setup**

   We recommend using Python >=3.10, PyTorch >=2.1.0, and CUDA >=12.1. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

   - Install Python 3.10 or later from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Create a new virtual environment and activate it:

     ```bash
     python -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
     ```

   - Install PyTorch and CUDA following the official [PyTorch installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

2. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone -b dev https://github.com/camenduru/InstantMesh
   cd InstantMesh
   ```

3. **Install Requirements**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Text-to-Image Generation**

   ```bash
   python get_images.py
   ```

2. **Image-to-Multiview Generation**

   ```bash
   python get_mv.py
   ```

3. **Multiview-to-3D Generation**

   ```bash
   python get_3d.py
   ```
